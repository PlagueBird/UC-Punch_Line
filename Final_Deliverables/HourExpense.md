#### **0. Documentation and Conceptualization - 25 hrs**
- **Project Documentation (10 hrs):** Did most of the coursework and documentation so that the two code-based roles could focus on learning unreal.
- **Roster Design (15 hrs):** Conceptualization of roster characters and design of both story information and to-be-used frame data for attacks.
    - Note: Frame Data starts at the animation phase, so I needed to have it prepped before it got to the code team.
#### **1. Learning – 27+ hours**
- **Blender Setup (2 hrs):** Blender Environment and Driver Setup
- **Learning Blender (25+ hrs):** Videos and Tutorials. Additional Environment Setup. Installing additional tools (Rigify, Looptools, etc.). This could theoretically be much higher.
#### **2. Pietro 1 and 2 – 38 hours**
- **Pietro 1 (18 hrs):** First Pietro. Modeling and vertex issues. Return to researching hotkets and fundamentals.
    - Notes: Pietro 1 dissolved. Lack of fundamentals in Blender meant that I needed to restart.
- **Pietro 2 (20 hrs):** Second Pietro. Successfully rigged! Too many vertices. Doesn't fit the game standard for "low-poly". The rig also failed.
    - Notes: Pietro 2 Unposable. Second, Pietro was riggable but couldn't generate a rig due largely in part to an error for "bone issues" and "spinal disconnect."
#### **3. Final Pietro – 18 hours**
- **Pietro 3 (18 hrs):** Successful Model with rigged animations for punching, kicking, jumping, and blasting. Other animations were omitted for time.
    - Edit: Zach, Code Lead, cannot implement the models with the interest of time. Hitbox work was done on the Unreal Mutant model and is transferrable to Pietro with an estimated 5 hours per every 3 animations.
#### Caleb Side Note: I legitimately pulled an 8-day bender of 1 hour of sleep per night to make Pietros 2 and 3. I reduced the hours significantly because a lot of the time was spent staring at the screen, trying to tweak models and watching tutorials. I now understand why people get entire degrees just for this. Oops. Hours on my end are logged based on pairwork with Anthony Shepard. Whenever he was doing homework or Senior Design Work, I was modeling a version of Pietro.

# Zach Brown
#### **1. Learning – 25 hours**
- **Unreal Engine Setup (1 hrs):** Installing UE5, configuring project settings, and understanding the interface.
- **Blueprints & C++ Integration (19 hrs):** Learning how to use Blueprints and C++ classes together effectively through tutorials and documentation.
- **AI & Research Tools (5 hrs):** Using AI (like ChatGPT and YouTube tutorials) to supplement knowledge gaps, debug errors, and enhance productivity.
#### **2. Development – 45 hours**
- **Initial Project Setup (6 hrs):** Creating a foundational template for the game that included project structure and key mechanics.
- **Character System & Roster Planning (2 hrs):** Collaborating to design the character roster and traits.
- **Importing & Implementing Assets (2 hrs):** Integrating 3D models and animations into Unreal
- **Gameplay Systems (25 hrs):** Implementing hit detection, health bars, character controls, and basic round logic using Blueprints and C++.   
- **UI & Feedback (4 hrs):** Creating basic UI elements like health bars and round indicators.   
- **Miscellaneous Tasks (6 hrs):** Managing assets, organizing files, bugs, and task coordinating.
#### **3. Testing – 10 hours**
- **Playtesting Core Features (8 hrs):** Testing hit detection, controls, round logic, and health bar functionality.
- **Controller Input Testing (2 hrs):** Verifying input handling for both keyboard and gamepad and resolving input recognition issues.

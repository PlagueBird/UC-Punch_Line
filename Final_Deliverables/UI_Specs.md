# UI Specifications
For this project their are two User Interfaces. 
The first User Interface is the main menu. The main menu is a very standard title screen with buttons. This is where the functionalities for local and online vs modes would be.
For most of our testing and actual interaction, this isn't super useful.
The second User Interface is the actual game. Health bars, special meters, and ability cool downs are tied to each player uniquely. The center of the top is for more universal mechanics such as the match timer.

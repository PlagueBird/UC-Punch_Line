# Abet_Constraints
By Zach Brown
There are some serious constraints that we are dealing with. For our economic constraints we are dealing with. We are lacking some artistic ability with game designs which we could overcome by paying some artists to help with sketches and design work. However given this is a senior project we don’t have the funds to do that. There is also an issue with servers given that this will be an online multiplayer game with users needing to be connected to a central server. For legal constraints we need to make sure to respect all trademarks and make sure any designs we create are 100% our own. For diversity and culture there are a few constraints. We are trying to bring in different “Clowns” archetypes from around the world. Therefore we need to verify that none of the archetypes we are using could promote any cultural biases or appear racist.

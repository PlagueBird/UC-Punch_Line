# Description
## Summary
Project Punch-ine is a fighting game ideated with the idea of "accessible fighting game".
As a group of devs, we play fighting games in our free time and realized that friends felt locked out of the genre by difficulty.
We also acknowledge the people that play fighting games for the in-depth mechanics and satisfaction.
Our game emphasizes a middle-ground of those prior two groups. A game that is satisfactory to learn and improve at without a floor that's too high for people to learn.

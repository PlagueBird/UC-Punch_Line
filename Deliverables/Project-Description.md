# Description
## Summary
Project Punch-ine is a fighting game ideated with the idea of "accessible fighting game".
As a group of devs, we play fighting games in our free time and realized that friends felt locked out of the genre by difficulty.
We also acknowledge the people that play fighting games for the in-depth mechanics and satisfaction.
Our game emphasizes a middle-ground of those prior two groups. A game that is satisfactory to learn and improve at without a floor that's too high for people to learn.

## Tools
- C# in Unity or Games Engine
- Rollback Netcode Server
- Blender for art
- Fruityloops for music

## Developer Upskilling
- Zach Brown: General Upskilling in UI and Backend Code
- Caleb Copley: General Upskilling in UI and Backend Code
- Anthony Shepard: Specific Upskilling in Network and Server Side

## Areas of Attention:
- Networking / Networks / Netcode
- UI vs Backend
- Frame Data / Response Time
- Dynamically Operating Systems

## Abstract
Project PUNCHLINE is the prototype for an easy access fighting game meant to teach. The game is currently in a spot where it still requires a lot of work but such is the way with fighting games. Currently, PUNCHLINE needs a lot of work. The models are created but have gone unimplemented and the network was successful but only up until a certain point where the code was overwritten. The project still has a lot of promise and each of us has left the bones for future functionality. Caleb Copley and Anthony Shepard plan on adopting the project and founding a dev studio to polish and push out PUNCHLINE.

Self Assessment

My contrinution towards this project that aligned with my original goals in the previous self-assessment are not currently visible. My aim and task was to implement network capabilities for our fighting game, but throughout development we were severely hindered by steep learning curves as this was our first experiences with Unreal Engine. Fortunately, Unreal has a vast amount of documentation and there are many guided tutorials that can be found on YouTube. Unfortunately, I was not able to start working towards aspects of networking for most of this project. The largest hurdles that I faced was that we as a group significantly struggled to develop the core gameplay aspects and basic functionality, so most of my effort went into working on the menus that would eventually be required for setting up network sessions. This was done with a blend of Blueprints, C++ files, and Widgets. This worked well, since it forwarded my progress towards networking, and I got to learn about many of the moving parts in Unreal Engine. I was able to get to the point that I had a start menu as well as an online menu that allowed you to host and search for sessions to join. This did not work for actually joining sessions because we had not developed the functionality to control two players on even one device yet, which the connection would work off of.

There were many instances like this, of having to backtrack to implement functionality for the game once I was caught up with where the game was at. This caused a lot of problems in the end, because when we worked on merging branches towards the end of the project, implementations differed on some base classes which caused all of the groundwork that the menus were structured on to be ineffectual, so our current version does not have the same menu functionality. I learned a lot throught this, albiet a bit late for my liking, about management in github to keep people on the same foundations, as well as taking more charge of development to ensure key milestones are implemented in regards to gameplay. As mentioned before, one of the biggest hurdles for us as a group was lack of prior knowledge on any of the tools we were using. Neither I nor Zac were familiar with Unreal Engine and Caleb was new to learning Blender. This meant that for each step, much more time was spent learning about the tools we were using than actually progressing our project. This did result in me learning a lot about Unreal Engine and game development, which used to seem very daunting, and is now something that I am interesting in continuing to pursue, even if just as a hobby.

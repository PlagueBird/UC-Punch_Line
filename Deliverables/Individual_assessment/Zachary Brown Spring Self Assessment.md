Over the course of this project, I worked on my very first Unreal Engine project, starting from the ground up. I began by installing and setting up Unreal Engine, familiarizing myself with the interface, and completing several tutorials to build a foundation in both Blueprints and C++ class integration. I leaned heavily on self-guided learning and AI tools to overcome the steep learning curve and accelerate my understanding. My first major contribution was creating a working initial template that served as a starting point for the entire group. This allowed us to quickly begin development with a shared structure and direction.

From there, I shifted my focus toward researching and importing character models and animations that would define our game's look and feel. I spent time learning how to manipulate animations in Unreal, including basic state machines and blend spaces. I implemented hit detection, health bars, and a round system to form the basis of a playable demo. This process strengthened my technical competencies, especially in working with game engines, version control, and real-time debugging. My biggest successes were overcoming the learning curve of Unreal and delivering a functional prototype. The main obstacles I faced were gaps in prior knowledge and technical complexity, but I actively problem-solved and learned through experimentation and collaboration. The obstacles of this project was the lack of fighting game knowledge I possess and overall the lack of game dev knowledge I have. Learning Unreal took up a large part of my development journey, which cost some polish for our final end product.  

Although this project was a group assignment, I found myself taking on a larger share of the work. Early in the process, I took initiative by setting up the project structure, organizing assets, researching tools, and developing a working prototype. I made efforts to encourage collaboration and share responsibilities.

This experience gave me an opportunity to grow in areas like project ownership, problem-solving, and staying motivated under pressure. I also learned a lot about how to communicate expectations and adapt when team dynamics arenâ€™t perfectly balanced. While the process had its challenges, it ultimately helped me build confidence in my ability to lead and follow through on technical projects.
